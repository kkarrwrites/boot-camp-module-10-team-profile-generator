# Boot Camp - Module 10 Challenge - Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: Team Profile Generator

## About

An OOP JavaScript, Node.js, and npm coding challenge for Full Stack Coding Boot Camp.

## Description

This is a command line interface (CLI) application written in JavaScript (with an emphasis on OOP) and built using Node.js and npm, particularly the file system module and Inquirer.js package. This CLI application asks a user a series of questions through CLI prompts and then produces an index.html file. A sample index.html can be found in the dist folder of this repo. The application also uses Jest to run the unit tests.
